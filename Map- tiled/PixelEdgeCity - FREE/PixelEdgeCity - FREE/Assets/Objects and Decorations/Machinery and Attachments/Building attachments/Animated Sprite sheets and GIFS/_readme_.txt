Here are the frame information for each animation

The windows and doors Opening/Closing animations are the same just in reverse. So, you can just reverse the opening animation if you want the closing animation and vice versa!

Also, i made a white version of the Doors, Windows etc so you can add any colour you want to.


(colour)_Door_1_anim: 	[4 frames]
(colour)_Door_2_anim: 	[4 frames]
(colour)_Window_1_anim: [4 frames]
(colour)_Window_2_anim: [4 frames]

Building_ACunit_1: 	[2 frames]
Building_ACunit_SIDE_1: [2 frames]
Building_ACunit_2: 	[2 frames]
Building_ACunit_SIDE_2: [has no side animation]
