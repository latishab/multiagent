I've created two versions of the character: one with hands and one without. The animations are identical, except the version without hands doesn't include the attack and the attack walk animations.

The idea is that the no-hands version is intended for ranged weapons. I've made the hands separate so weapons can rotate freely in all directions.

But you can use it however you want!
