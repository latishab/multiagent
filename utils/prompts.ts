  4: 'I recommend the Urban Agriculture Zones. They create community spaces and improve food security. The industrial expansion might bring more tax revenue, but it eliminates green spaces and increases pollution. We need to balance economic growth with community wellbeing.',
  5: 'I recommend the Public Shared Reservoir. Water is a basic human right that shouldn\'t be privatized. The tiered contracts might encourage conservation, but they could create water poverty for low-income families. Equal access ensures no one goes thirsty.',
